👋🏻 Hi! My name is Sasha!

 👨🏻‍💻 I am currently on the path of changing carreers and I am studying programming.  
 📚 I have already learned and had a chance to practice on things like HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, ReactJS, AJAX as well as touched upon few other technologies like Node.js and Mocha.  
 💡 At the moment I am doing Full-Stack Engineer course at [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/onelegtony).
